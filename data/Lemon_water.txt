Lemon water is a beverage made by mixing lemon juice with water. 

It is commonly consumed for its taste and as part of everyday dietary or lifestyle habits. Lemon water mainly provides hydration along with small amounts of nutrients naturally found in lemon juice, especially vitamin C.


Preparation and consumption


Common preparation
Lemon water is usually prepared by adding freshly squeezed lemon juice to cold or warm water. A common method uses the juice of half a lemon in a glass of water, though the amount varies by preference.


Variations
Some people add ingredients such as mint or ginger for flavor. These additions mainly affect taste and do not significantly change the nutritional value of the drink.


Nutritional content


Basic nutrients
Lemon water is low in calories.
Lemon juice contributes small amounts of vitamin C and citric acid; however, when diluted in water, the overall nutrient content remains modest compared to whole fruit.

Lemon water contributes to hydration and supplies small amounts of nutrients derived from lemon juice. Its nutritional value depends on the quantity of juice used and is substantially lower than that of whole lemons due to dilution in water.
Because the pulp and peel are typically removed during preparation, lemon water contains little to no dietary fiber.


Comparison with whole fruit
Compared to consuming whole lemons, lemon water provides fewer nutrients because it consists primarily of diluted lemon juice and water. Whole lemons contain dietary fiber, particularly soluble fiber such as pectin, which is largely absent in lemon water due to the removal of pulp and peel during preparation.
In addition to fiber, whole lemons provide a broader range of micronutrients and plant-derived compounds, including amino acids, fatty acids, and polyphenols, many of which are concentrated in the pulp and peel and are present in reduced amounts when only lemon juice is diluted in water.
